      "Learn how to effectively use the useEffect hook in React to handle side effects like fetching data and interacting with the DOM.",
    content: `# Mastering useEffect in React

The \`useEffect\` hook is essential for managing side effects in React.

## üß† What is useEffect?

It allows you to:

- Fetch data
- Subscribe/unsubscribe
- Perform DOM manipulation

## ‚öôÔ∏è Basic Syntax

\`\`\`js
useEffect(() => {
  console.log("Component mounted");
}, []);
\`\`\`

> The empty array means the effect runs only once, when the component mounts.

## üåê Example: Fetching Data

\`\`\`js
useEffect(() => {
  fetch('/api/data')
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(setData);
}, []);
\`\`\`

    content: `# Understanding Props vs State in React

React apps rely heavily on two key data types: **props** and **state**.

## üß© Props

Props are **read-only** values passed from parent to child components.

\`\`\`js
<MyComponent name="Test" />
\`\`\`

## ‚ö° State

State is **local data** managed within a component.

\`\`\`js
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
\`\`\`

> Think of props as *inputs*, and state as *local memory*.
