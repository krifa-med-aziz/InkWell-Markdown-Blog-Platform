## üóÑÔ∏è Data Management

### Initial Data Population

When users visit the site for the first time, their localStorage will be empty. To provide a better user experience, the application automatically populates the localStorage with sample blog posts on first load.

#### How it works:

1. **Featured Posts**: Sample posts are defined in `src/utils/data.ts`
2. **Auto-initialization**: The `useLocalStorage` hook automatically checks if the "posts" key exists in localStorage
3. **First Load**: If no posts exist, it populates localStorage with the featured posts from `data.ts`
4. **Subsequent Visits**: Uses existing data from localStorage

#### Manual Data Population (Development):

If you need to reset or manually populate the data during development, you can uncomment this line in `src/utils/data.ts`:

```typescript
localStorage.setItem("posts", JSON.stringify(featuredPosts));
```

Run this in the browser console or temporarily uncomment it in the code.

### Data Structure

Each blog post follows this structure:

```typescript
{
  id: string;              // Unique identifier
  title: string;           // Post title
  author: string;          // Author name
  date: string;           // Publication date (YYYY-MM-DD)
  lastUpdatedDate: string; // Last modified date
  tags: string[];         // Category tags
  image: string;          // Cover image URL
  excerpt: string;        // Post summary
  content: string;        // Markdown content
}
```

## üéØ Usage

4. Click "Publish Post" to save

3. Remove bookmarks by clicking the icon again

```

The built files will be in the `dist` directory.

### Deployment Notes

- **Static Hosting**: This app can be deployed to any static hosting service (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, etc.)
- **Data Persistence**: All data is stored in localStorage, so it's user-specific and persists across sessions
- **No Backend Required**: The app is completely client-side and doesn't require a server
